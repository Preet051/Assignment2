a straightforward food application created for a class project with Android Studio.


## Usability

The following functionalities are available in the FoodApp:

- **Sign In**: To view their customised content, users must log in.
**Recipe Administration**: Users are able to see, add, and modify recipes.
- **Meal Planning**: Users can arrange their meals according to dates by using a meal planner.
- **Blogging**: People can start and distribute blogs detailing their food adventures.
- **Contact**: The app offers a method for users or the makers to get in touch.
- **User Profiles**: The 'About Me' feature allows users to access and modify their personal data.

## Ideas Employed

- **MVC Architecture**: Code is arranged for maintainability into Model, View, and Controller.
- **Shared Preferences**: Preserving session information and user preferences.
- **Fragment Management**: Handles numerous views in a single activity by using fragments.
**AlertDialogs**: Utilising dialogue boxes to edit profiles and receive user input.
- **Data linking**: By directly linking UI components to data sources, code is minimised.
